# Dynamics-365-Copilot-for-Sales

Copilot is an AI assistant in Dynamics 365 Sales that helps sales teams be more productive and efficient in their daily work. It has a chat interface that sellers can use to get a quick summary of their opportunity and lead records, catch up on recent changes to their records, prepare for meetings, and read the latest news about their accounts.

Copilot is also available as an add-in in Outlook and an integrated app in Teams. With it, sellers can capture, view, and update their customer account data in the apps they use every day. The add-in and Teams app have generative AI capabilities such as record summarization and email content generation.

Copilot is turned on by default for tenants in North America, in all Sales apps that have lead and opportunity entities. If your tenant is in a different region, an admin needs to turn on Copilot manually.
