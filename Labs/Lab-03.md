# Lab 03: Use AI to supercharge sales communication 

## Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates how Copilot for Sales streamlines CRM updates from customer email interactions. Instead of manually updating CRM systems, which can be time-consuming and error-prone, Copilot for Sales uses AI to summarize email conversations. These summaries can be efficiently added as notes to your CRM records, highlighting key details like budget, stakeholders, needs, and timing for external emails when detected with high confidence. You will learn to set up and use Copilot for Sales to enhance your CRM update process.
